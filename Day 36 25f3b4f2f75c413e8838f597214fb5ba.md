### Demonstrating using structs to carry data

Every time we text something in the textfield, behind the scenes,  an entirely new struct is being created. He says it’s actually very fast. Changing to “class” instead of “struct” doesn’t work here because “private var user” is not changing, the values inside the Class user are changing but not the var user itself. This means the struct cannot spot the change and doesn’t reload the view.

```swift
struct User {
    var firstName = "Bilbo"
    var lastName = "Baggins"
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var user = User()
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Your name is \(user.firstName) \(user.lastName)")
            
            TextField("First name", text: $user.firstName)
            TextField("First name", text: $user.firstName)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

### Changing the above to actually be classes

As said above, changing the struct to a class doesn’t work. However, adding @Observable on the line above does work. @Observable says to update any view that relies on the class user when properties change.  By adding import Observation, we can double click on @Observable and it will show all the code imported by SwiftUI. The @State private var just keeps the variable alive and attached to the view. All the watching of the view is handled by Observable, not by @State.

```swift
import Observation
import SwiftUI

@Observable
class User {
    var firstName = "Bilbo"
    var lastName = "Baggins"
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var user = User()
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Your name is \(user.firstName) \(user.lastName)")
            
            TextField("First name", text: $user.firstName)
            TextField("First name", text: $user.firstName)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

### Showing sheets and using views declared elsewherre

```swift
struct SecondView: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss
    let name: String
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, \(name)")
        Button("Dismiss") {
            dismiss()
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingSheet = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Show sheet") {
            showingSheet.toggle()
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingSheet) {
            SecondView(name: "Sam")
        }
    }
}
```

### Creating a list we can add to and delete from using the onDelete() modifier

```swift
import SwiftUI
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var numbers = [Int]()
    @State private var currentNumber = 1
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            VStack {
                List {
                    ForEach(numbers, id: \.self) {
                        Text("Row \($0)")
                    }
                    .onDelete(perform: removeRows)
                }
                Button("Add number") {
                    numbers.append(currentNumber)
                    currentNumber += 1
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("iExpense")
            .toolbar {
                EditButton()
            }
        }
    }
    
    func removeRows(at offsets: IndexSet) {
        numbers.remove(atOffsets: offsets)
    }
}
```

## UserDefaults

Maximum 512 kb here (a novel worth of words). UserDefaults booleans have a default value of false, so it’s not clear if it’s a value you set or if there’s no value at all. It also takes a little bit of time for iPhone to write to user defaults (could be a few seconds).

### Create UserDefaults Value

```swift
UserDefaults.standard.set(tapCount, forKey: "Tap")
```

### Retrieve UserDefaults Value

```swift
UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: "Tap") //Where integer is the type being stored
```

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var tapCount = UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: "Tap")
    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Count: \(tapCount)") {
            tapCount += 1
            UserDefaults.standard.set(tapCount, forKey: "Tap")
        }
    }
}
```

### @AppStorage as an alternative

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @AppStorage("tapCount") private var tapCount = 0
    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Count: \(tapCount)") {
            tapCount += 1
        }
    }
}
```

### Codable Structs (Archiving Swift Objects with Codable)

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let firstName: String
    let lastName: String
}
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var user = User(firstName: "Taylor", lastName: "Swift")

    var body: some View {
        Button("Save User") {
            let encoder = JSONEncoder()
            
            if let data = try? encoder.encode(user) {
                UserDefaults.standard.set(data, forKey: "UserData")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
